        <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic.
          The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye,
          and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
